# Creating an L2 Rollup on Optimism

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating an L2 rollup on Optimism. 

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of blockchain and rollups.
- Familiarity with Ethereum and Solidity.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Node.js
- pnpm

You can install pnpm using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```
## Step 2: Clone the Optimism Repository

Clone the Optimism monorepo from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
cd optimism
pnpm install
```
## Step 3: Configure the Rollup

To configure your rollup, you will need to modify certain configuration files. For example, edit 'rollup.config.js' to specify the parameters for your rollup.

```js
// rollup.config.js
export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    file: 'dist/bundle.js',
    format: 'cjs',
  },
  plugins: [resolve(), commonjs()],
};
```
## Step 4: Deploy the Rollup

Deploy your rollup using the provided scripts. Make sure to follow the detailed steps in the documentation to correctly deploy your rollup.

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```
