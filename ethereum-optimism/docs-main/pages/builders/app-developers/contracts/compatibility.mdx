# Solidity Compatibility

OP Mainnet is designed to be [EVM equivalent](https://web.archive.org/web/20231127160757/https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), which means OP Mainnet looks exactly like Ethereum in every way possible.
Almost all Ethereum tooling works out of the box on OP Mainnet, including the [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) smart contract language.
However, there are a few minor differences between OP Mainnet and Ethereum that you should be aware of when building Solidity contracts.

## EVM/Opcode Differences

Most smart contracts will work on OP Mainnet without any changes.
Check out the [Differences Between Ethereum and OP Mainnet](/chain/differences#opcodes) page for a detailed list of the few differences you should know about.

## Gas Differences

OP Mainnet uses the same gas costs as Ethereum.
However, OP Mainnet also charges an [L1 Data Fee](/stack/transactions/fees#l1-data-fee) for the cost of publishing an L2 transaction to L1.
This fee is charged based on the size of a transaction in bytes.
As a result, smart contract optimization techniques can differ slightly on OP Mainnet.
Refer to the [Contract Optimization guide](./optimization) for more information.
