# Chain Configuration

The OP Stack is a flexible platform with various configuration values that you can tweak to fit your specific needs. If you're looking to fine-tune your OP Stack chain deployment, look no further.

<Callout type="warning">
  Work in Progress

  OP Stack configuration is an active work in progress and will likely evolve significantly as time goes on. If something isn't working about your configuration, check back with this page to see if anything has changed.

## New Blockchain Configuration

New OP Stack blockchains are currently configured with a JSON file inside the Optimism repository. The file is `<optimism repository>/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/<chain name>.json`. For example, [this is the configuration file for the tutorial blockchain](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/129032f15b76b0d2a940443a39433de931a97a44/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/getting-started.json).

| `proxyAdminOwner`  | L2 Address | Address that will own the `ProxyAdmin` contract on L2. The L2 `ProxyAdmin` contract owns all of the `Proxy` contracts for every predeployed contract in the range `0x42...0000` to `0x42..2048`.

| `l2OutputOracleProposer`            | L1 Address        | Address that is allowed to submit output proposals to the `L2OutputOracle` contract.

#### Setting your `l2OutputOracleSubmissionInterval`

When deploying your contracts, you can set the `l2OutputOracleSubmissionInterval` to any value you wish to save on costs (e.g., 24 hours or 12 hours). On OP mainnet, `l2OutputOracleSubmissionInterval` is set to `1800 L2 blocks = 1 hr`.
The tradeoff here is that users will only be able to prove withdrawals after an output root is posted, so users will have to submit their L2 withdrawal transaction, wait up to the number of hours in the submission interval, then prove on L1, then wait 1 week, then finalize.

<Callout type="info">
  After fault proofs are shipped to Mainnet, output roots can be submitted as infrequently as you wish, and there won't be a submission interval anymore.

#### Set Your  `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION`

<Callout>
  The default value inside `op-batcher`, if not specified, is still `0`, which means channel duration tracking is disabled.
  For very low throughput chains, this would mean to fill channels until close to the sequencing window and post the channel to `L1 SUB_SAFETY_MARGIN` L1 blocks before the sequencing window expires.
</Callout>

To minimize costs, we recommend setting your  `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` to target 5 hours, with a value of `1500` L1 blocks. When non-zero, this parameter is the max time (in L1 blocks, which are 12 seconds each) between which batches will be submitted to the L1. If you have this set to 5 for example, then your batcher will send a batch to the L1 every 5\*12=60 seconds. When using blobs, because 130kb blobs need to be purchased in full, if your chain doesn't generate at least \~130kb of data in those 60 seconds, then you'll be posting only partially full blobs and wasting storage.

*   We do not recommend setting any values higher than targeting 5 hours, as batches have to be submitted within the sequencing window which defaults to 12 hours for OP chains, otherwise your chain may experience a 12 hour long chain reorg. 5 hours is the longest length of time we recommend that still sits snugly within that 12 hour window to avoid affecting stability.
*   If your chain fills up full blobs of data before the `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` elapses, a batch will be submitted anyways - (e.g. even if the OP Mainnet batcher sets an `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` of 5 hours, it will still be submitting batches every few minutes)

<Callout type="warning">
  While setting an`OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` of `1500` results in the cheapest fees, it also means that your [safe head](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/glossary.md#safe-l2-head) can stall for up to 5 hours.

  *   This will negatively impact apps on your chain that rely on the safe head for operation. While many apps can likely operate simply by following the unsafe head, often Centralized Exchanges or third party bridges wait until transactions are marked safe before processing deposits and withdrawal.
  *   Thus a larger gap between posting batches can result in significant delays in the operation of certain types of high-security applications.
</Callout>

#### Configure Your Batcher to Use Multiple Blobs

The `op-batcher` has the capabilities to send multiple blobs per single blob transaction. This is accomplished by the use of multi-frame channels, see the [specs](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/derivation.html#frame-format) for more technical details on channels and frames.

A minimal batcher configuration (with env vars) to enable 6-blob batcher transactions is:

```
  - OP_BATCHER_BATCH_TYPE=1 # span batches, optional
  - OP_BATCHER_DATA_AVAILABILITY_TYPE=blobs
  - OP_BATCHER_TARGET_NUM_FRAMES=6 # 6 blobs per tx
  - OP_BATCHER_TXMGR_MIN_BASEFEE=2.0 # 2 gwei, might need to tweak, depending on gas market
  - OP_BATCHER_TXMGR_MIN_TIP_CAP=2.0 # 2 gwei, might need to tweak, depending on gas market
  - OP_BATCHER_RESUBMISSION_TIMEOUT=240s # wait 4 min before bumping fees
```

This enables blob transactions and sets the target number of frames to 6, which translates to 6 blobs per transaction.
The minimum tip cap and base fee are also lifted to 2 gwei because it is uncertain how easy it will be to get 6-blob transactions included and slightly higher priority fees should help.
The resubmission timeout is increased to a few minutes to give more time for inclusion before bumping the fees because current transaction pool implementations require a doubling of fees for blob transaction replacements.

Multi-blob transactions are particularly useful for medium to high-throughput chains, where enough transaction volume exists to fill up 6 blobs in a reasonable amount of time.
You can use [this calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12VIiXHaVECG2RUunDSVJpn67IQp9NHFJqUsma2PndpE/edit) for your chain to determine what number of blobs are right for you, and what gas scalar configuration to use. Please also refer to guide on [Using Blobs](/builders/chain-operators/management/blobs) for chain operators.
