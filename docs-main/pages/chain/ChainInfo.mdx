# Chain Node Information Overview

This document provides an overview of three key nodes within the Adventure Layer network: `shard1`, `sequencer_node`, and `replica_node1`. These nodes work together to ensure the stability and performance of the network, offering efficient and reliable on-chain services.

## 1. Shard1 Node

`shard1` is a shard node in the network responsible for processing a portion of the network's transactions and state data. This helps to improve the overall scalability and transaction throughput of the network.

- **Shard ID**: 12340188
- **HTTP Endpoint**: [https://rpc-devnet.adventurelayer.xyz/node1/shard](https://rpc-devnet.adventurelayer.xyz/node1/shard)
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `wss://rpc-devnet.adventurelayer.xyz/node1/shard`

## 2. Sequencer Node

The `sequencer_node` is responsible for ordering transactions within the network, ensuring that they are processed in a specific sequence and then broadcasted to the relevant shard nodes for validation.

- **Node ID**: 242069
- **HTTP Endpoint**: [https://rpc-devnet.adventurelayer.xyz](https://rpc-devnet.adventurelayer.xyz)
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `wss://rpc-devnet.adventurelayer.xyz`

## 3. Replica Node1

`replica_node1` is a replica node in the network, tasked with replicating and maintaining the confirmed transactions and state data, ensuring data availability and persistence.

- **Node ID**: 242069
- **HTTP Endpoint**: [https://rpc-devnet.adventurelayer.xyz/node1](https://rpc-devnet.adventurelayer.xyz/node1)
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `wss://rpc-devnet.adventurelayer.xyz/node1`
