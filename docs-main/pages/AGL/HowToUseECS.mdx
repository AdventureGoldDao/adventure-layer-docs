# How to Use Our ECS Project

### 1) Create Demo Project Using Command

To create a demo project, you typically use a command-line tool or script. You can use the scaffolding command we provide to initialize the project. You can use the following command:

```bash
pnpm create adventure-engine demo-project
```

### 2) Add Tables and Contracts

To add a table and contract, you need to define them in your configuration and codebase. For example, in your `mud.config.ts` file, you define tables like this:

```typescript
tables: {
  Users: {
    schema: {
      player: "address",
      gameCode: "uint32",
      score: "uint32",
      username: "string",
    },
    key: ["player"],
  },
  GameCodeToGameState: {
    schema: {
      gameCode: "uint32",
      players: "address[]",
    },
    key: ["gameCode"],
  }
}
```

For contracts, you would create new Solidity files in the `src/systems` or `src/codegen` directories and define your contract logic there.

### 3) How to Generate Automated Code

Automated code generation can be done using scripts or tools that read your configuration and generate the necessary code files. In your setup, this might involve running a build script that uses the `mud` tool to generate code based on your `mud.config.ts`.

```json
"build": "mud build",
"clean": "forge clean && shx rm -rf src/**/codegen",
```

### 4) Modify Heartbeat Contract

To modify a heartbeat contract, you would typically edit the Solidity file where the contract is defined. The heartbeat mechanism might be implemented in a contract that periodically triggers certain actions, such as refreshing game state or generating new game elements.

### 5) How to Compile and Deploy

To compile and deploy your contracts, you can use the scripts defined in your `package.json`. For example, you might have scripts like these:

```json
"deploy:dev": "mud deploy --profile=dev",
"deploy:local": "mud deploy",
"deploy:prod": "mud deploy --profile=prod",
```

- **Compile**: Run `npm run build` or `pnpm run build` to compile your contracts.
- **Deploy**: Use `npm run deploy:dev` or `npm run deploy:prod` to deploy your contracts to the desired network.

These steps should guide you through using your ECS setup effectively. If you have specific questions about any step, feel free to ask!
