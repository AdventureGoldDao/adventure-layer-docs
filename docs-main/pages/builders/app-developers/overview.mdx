If you're a developer looking to build on Adventure Layer  Testnet, you've come to the right place.
In this area of the Adventure Layer Docs you'll find everything you need to know about building Adventure Layer  Testnet applications.

## Getting Started

If you're brand new to Adventure Layer  Testnet, try starting with the guide on [deploying a basic contract](/chain/getting-started).
It'll get you familiar with the basic steps required to get a contract deployed to the network.
Adventure Layer  Testnet is [EVM equivalent](https://web.archive.org/web/20231127160757/https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306) so you can feel confident that your existing Ethereum smart contract skills will carry over to Adventure Layer  Testnet.
Just make sure to be aware of the few small [differences between Ethereum and Adventure Layer  Testnet](/chain/differences).

You might also want to check out the [testing on Adventure Layer Networks guide](/chain/testing/testing-apps) and the tutorial on [running a local development environment](/chain/testing/dev-node) to help you feel totally confident in your Adventure Layer  Testnet deployment.

## Bridging and Messaging

Looking to build an application that sends ETH, tokens, or data between Adventure Layer  Testnet and Ethereum?
You'll find some useful guides and tutorials in this area of the docs.
For instance, if you want to learn how to bridge a token from Ethereum to Adventure Layer  Testnet (or vice versa!), you should check out the [Standard Token Bridge](bridging/standard-bridge).

If you're looking for something more advanced, take a look at the guide on [sending data between L1 and L2](bridging/messaging).
Contracts on one chain can trigger contract functions on the other chain, it's pretty cool!
The Standard Token Bridge for Adventure Layer  Testnet even uses this same message-passing infrastructure under the hood.

## Tutorials

If you're a bit more familiar with Adventure Layer  Testnet and Ethereum, you can try walking through one of the tutorials put together by the Adventure Layer community.
They'll help you get a head start when building your first Optimistic project.
