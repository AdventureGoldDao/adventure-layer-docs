## How to run an Adventure Layer node

**The Adventure Layer** is built upon an optimistic rollup framework chosen for its efficiency and compatibility with Ethereum L1. This layer serves as the base where transactions are batched and executed off-chain, with final state commitments made on Ethereum L1. This setup ensures that the core operations benefit from the security of the main Ethereum network while operating at greater speed and at a lower cost.

### Step 1. Clone the [adventure-layer-scripts](https://github.com/DavidCoder88/adventure-layer-scripts) repo

```
  `git clone https://github.com/DavidCoder88/adventure-layer-scripts.git`
```

### Step 2. init

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

### Step 3. update config run

```bash
sudo apt install direnv
echo `eval "$(direnv hook bash)"` >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

direnv allow
```

### Step 4.sequencer

```bash
cd ./sequencer-node
#init
./init.sh
#run
./run-all.sh
#stop
./stop.sh
```

### Step 5.repolica

```bash
cd ./repolica-node
#init
./init.sh
#run
./run-all.sh
#stop
./stop.sh
```
