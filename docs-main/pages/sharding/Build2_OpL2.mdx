title: How to run a replica node
---

### Step 1: Clone the [adventure-layer-scripts](https://github.com/DavidCoder88/adventure-layer-scripts) repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidCoder88/adventure-layer-scripts.git
```
- Use the `git clone` command to clone the `adventure-layer-scripts` repository from GitHub. This will download all files from the repository to your local machine.

### Step 2: Initialize the environment configuration

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```
- Copy the `.envrc.example` file to `.envrc`. This file contains example configurations for environment variables that you can modify as needed.

### Step 3: Update configuration and run

```bash
sudo apt install direnv
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

direnv allow
```
- Install the `direnv` tool, which automatically loads and unloads environment variables specific to the directory.
- Add the `direnv` hook to your `.bashrc` file and reload `.bashrc` to enable `direnv` in the current shell session.
- Run `direnv allow` to allow `direnv` to load environment variables from the `.envrc` file.

### Step 4: Run the Replica Node

```bash
cd ./repolica-node
# init
./init.sh
# run
./run-all.sh
# stop
./stop.sh
```
1. **Navigate to the directory**: Use the `cd ./repolica-node` command to navigate to the `repolica-node` directory.

2. **Initialize**:
    ```bash
    ./init.sh
    ```
    - Run the `./init.sh` script to initialize the Replica Node. This typically involves setting up necessary files and configurations.

3. **Run**:
    ```bash
    ./run-all.sh
    ```
    - Run the `./run-all.sh` script to start the Replica Node. This script will start all necessary processes and services, allowing the node to begin running and handling requests.

4. **Stop**:
    ```bash
    ./stop.sh
    ```
    - Run the `./stop.sh` script to stop the Replica Node. This script will stop all related processes and services, ensuring the node shuts down safely.
