title: Testing Contracts
---
To ensure your smart contracts function as intended, you can use the Stylus demos available in the [adventure-layer-scripts](https://github.com/DavidCoder88/adventure-layer-scripts) repository on GitHub. These demos provide practical examples and testing scenarios to validate your contracts.

### Steps to Test Your Contracts

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the adventure-layer-scripts repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DavidCoder88/adventure-layer-scripts.git
   ```

2. **Initialize the Environment**: Navigate to the `stylus-demos` directory and set up your environment:
   ```sh
   cd adventure-layer-scripts/stylus-demos
   cp ./scripts.env.example .env
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contract**: Use the provided script to deploy your contract:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

4. **Test the ERC20 Contract**: Run the test script to validate the ERC20 contract:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/test-erc20.sh
   ```

5. **Get Contract ABI**: Retrieve the contract ABI using the script provided:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/abi.sh
   ```
