## Introduction to WASM and Stylus

### WebAssembly (WASM)

WebAssembly (WASM) is a modern low-level programming language designed to provide high-performance runtime environments for the web platform. It compiles code from various programming languages such as Rust, C, and C++ into a binary format that can run on browsers or servers. WASM is widely used in the development of smart contracts due to its efficient execution speed and cross-platform capabilities.

### Stylus

Stylus is a development platform that supports WASM contracts, specifically designed for the Arbitrum chain. It enables developers to write smart contracts in WASM, offering higher execution efficiency and lower costs compared to traditional EVM-based contracts. With Stylus, contract development becomes more flexible and efficient, seamlessly integrating with the existing ecosystem of Arbitrum and providing robust support for decentralized applications (DApps).
